title: Why do I need a blog?
---


This blog is inspired by Jeff Triplett's [Please publish and share more](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/11/02/please-publish-and.html?utm_source=pocket_shared).

Here are a few (adjusted) quotes I embraced, which lead me to this point:

> _You donâ€™t have to change the world with every post. You might publish a quick thought or two that helps encourage someone else to learn or try something new_

> _Posts are done when you say they are. They're done when you stop writing, which doesn't require the perfect insight or conclusion_

I've been thinking about this for years, and never got over the hump.
I was always writing sporadically, and some of my posts reached audiences I never imagined, opening doors to new opportunities.
But a blog for small thoughts and insights? that's something I never had. Let's see if it sticks.
